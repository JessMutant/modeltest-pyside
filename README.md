ModelTest is a part of the Qt test suite that provides a way to check for common errors in implementations of QAbstractItemModel.

ModelTest-PySide is a port of this test from C++ to python, aiming at testing QAbstractItemModel-derived classes written with PySide. It is probably usable with PyQt too (I did not try).
